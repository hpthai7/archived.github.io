Introduction

What is test-driven development?

It's a process that facilitates test cases for the verification of requirements.

From the mantra of Test-Driven Development: writing failed tests before writing codes, and eliminating duplication,
the three-step rule is put forth:
- Write a test at first
- Correct the code to make the test work
- Refactor

Why TDD?

Automated testing reduces work on the verification, modification and maintenance of code.
In a similar context with the 'divide and conquer' strategy, large junks of code are broken into verifiable units.

How to conduct TDD?
Before start coding, it's good practice to write down all possible tests. For each test


Where test-driven development not primarily viable?
- Security
- Concurrency
- User interface
